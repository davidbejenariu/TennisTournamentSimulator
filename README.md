Given statistics about tennis players, the script will use the Simulator to predict the outcome of several tournaments involving all the players.

Tournaments are simulated point by point using the uniform distribution on odds that are calculated before every match and adjusted depending on sets won, which player is serving or the surface the match is being played on.

In the end, the script provides plots representing the point win percentage for a certain player during the tournaments and for all the players after tournaments are finished.
